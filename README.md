# Mein-Kolonie-Datapack
A datapack integrating different mods with minecolonies

New Research:
  -Cutting board: adds cooking related Farmers Delight recipes they wouldm't otherwise be able to learn
  -Cooking pot: adds many cooking pot recipes from Farmers Delight, not all ingredient combinations are possible as the request system is confused by products with many    different recipes. It will usually request the first version of the recipe in their list of crafting recipes. Priorites can be changed by changing the order with the    arrows in the restaurant GUI.
  -Neptune's Blessing: adds the Neptune's Bounty loot table from  aquaculture to the level 5 fisherman bonus loot table, costs a diamond fishing rod
